# StickyNotes #

A set of PowerShell functions for using Sticky Notes in Windows. These commands
require PowerShell version 5 and a client version of Windows prior to Windows 10. 
Recently tested versions of Windows 10 show that the command line utility
Stikynot.exe has been replaced with a modern *metro* style application which
does not behave the same way. For now, this module won't work on Windows 10.
